# Stock-Prediction-using-twitterdata
Project Description:
This project is about analyzing social media data about Apple Inc. and predicting its future stock trend with sentiment classification. We applied sentiment analysis and
machine learning principles to discover the possible effect of "public sentiment" on "market trends".

Prediction of stock price is an extremely complex and very challenging task because there are too many factors involved such as economic circumstances, political events, 
and other environmental factors which may impact the stock price. Due to these factors, it is difficult to find out the dependence of a single factor on future prices and
trends.

The popularity and importance of numerous social media platforms has risen to new levels over the past few years, as more people spend time online. One such social media 
platform that has seen an explosive rise in popularity is Twitter. Twitter is a rich source of real-time information regarding current societal trends and opinions. 
The "Twittesphere" is a melting pot driving various opinions, emotions and trends and could be a pivotal factor in influencing and shaping perceptions.
